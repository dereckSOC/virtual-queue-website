# virtual-queue-website
Singapore Polytechnic Year 2 Virtual Queue Website Project

The purpose of this website is to let users track the number of people in a queue at a given time through the use of graphs to display the data. Our main target audience are restaurant managers and the goal is to provide a platform for them to oversee the number of customers that are currently in queue. The project is coded in HTML and Javascript, with the help of PostgreSQL.
